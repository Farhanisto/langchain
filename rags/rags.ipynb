    "Is a method where we combine LLMs with a retrival system. This retrival system can search through vast sources of external information like documents, databases or knowledge bases. Whenever an LLM needs additianal sources of information.\n",

    "Chucking is a process where we can split big documents into several smaller chucks, Next this chucks are converted to embeddings by the LLM embedder, this usually costs money.

      "until to Men it may seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact,\n",

      "professional skill that heredity and practice, and a close friendship\n",
      "with the earth, have rendered inimitable by bigger and clumsier races.\n",
      "For they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less stout and\n",

      "were fairer of skin and also of hair, and they were taller and slimmer\n",
      "than the others; they were lovers of trees and of woodlands.\n",
      "The Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times, and\n",
      "long lived in the foothills of the mountains. They moved westward\n",
      "early, and roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while the others\n",
      "were still in Wilderland. They were the most normal and representative variety of Hobbit, and far the most numerous. They were\n",
      "the most inclined to settle in one place, and longest preserved their\n",
      "ancestral habit of living in tunnels and holes.\n",
      "The Stoors lingered long by the banks of the Great River Anduin,\n",
      "and were less shy of Men. They came west after the Harfoots and\n",
      "followed the course of the Loudwater southwards; and there many\n",

      "before they moved north again.\n",

      "The Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. They\n",

      "more skill in language and song than in handicrafts; and of old they\n",
      "preferred hunting to tilling. They crossed the mountains north of\n",
      "Rivendell and came down the River Hoarwell. In Eriador they soon\n",
      "mingled with the other kinds that had preceded them, but being\n",
      "somewhat bolder and more adventurous, they were often found as\n",
      "leaders or chieftains among clans of Harfoots or Stoors. Even in\n",
      "Bilbo’s time the strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among the greater families, such as the Tooks and the Masters of Buckland.\n",

      "Men that came over the Sea out of Westernesse; but they were dwindling fast and the lands of their North Kingdom were falling far and\n",
      "wide into waste. There was room and to spare for incomers, and ere\n",

      "to Gondor, and about all the coasts of the Sea from Belfalas to Lune.\n",

      "and first year of the Third Age that the Fallohide brothers, Marcho\n",
      "and Blanco, set out from Bree; and having obtained permission from\n",
      "the high king at Fornost,* they crossed the brown river Baranduin\n",
      "with a great following of Hobbits. They passed over the Bridge of\n",
      "Stonebows, that had been built in the days of the power of the North\n",
      "Kingdom, and they took all the land beyond to dwell in, between\n",

      "things moved, until they came to think that peace and plenty were\n",
      "the rule in Middle-earth and the right of all sensible folk. They forgot\n",

      "At no time had Hobbits of any kind been warlike, and they had\n",

      "Since he was lost in the dark without hope, and could neither go\n",

      "many riddles. In the end Bilbo won the game, more by luck (as it seemed) than by wits; for he was stumped at last for a riddle to ask,\n",
      "and cried out, as his hand came upon the ring he had picked up and\n",

      "answer, Gollum was bound by his promise. And Bilbo pressed him\n",
      "to keep his word; for the thought came to him that this slimy creature\n",
      "might prove false, even though such promises were held sacred, and\n",
      "of old all but the wickedest things feared to break them. But after\n",
      "ages alone in the dark Gollum’s heart was black, and treachery was\n",
      "in it. He slipped away, and returned to his island, of which Bilbo\n",
      "knew nothing, not far off in the dark water. There, he thought, lay\n",

      "fled blindly up the passage away from the water; and once more he\n",
      "was saved by his luck. For as he ran he put his hand in his pocket,\n",
      "and the ring slipped quietly on to his finger. So it was that Gollum\n",
      "passed him without seeing him, and went to guard the way out, lest\n",
      "the ‘thief’ should escape. Warily Bilbo followed him, as he went\n",
      "along, cursing, and talking to himself about his ‘Precious’; from which\n",
      "talk at last even Bilbo guessed the truth, and hope came to him in\n",

      "was tempted to slay him with his sword. But pity stayed him, and\n",
      "though he kept the ring, in which his only hope lay, he would not\n",
      "use it to help him kill the wretched creature at a disadvantage. In the\n",
      "end, gathering his courage, he leaped over Gollum in the dark, and\n",
      "fled away down the passage, pursued by his enemy’s cries of hate\n",
      "and despair: Thief, thief! Baggins! We hates it for ever!\n",
      "Now it is a curious fact that this is not the story as Bilbo first told\n",
      "it to his companions. To them his account was that Gollum had\n",
      "promised to give him a present, if he won the game; but when Gollum went to fetch it from his island he found the treasure was gone: a\n",
      "magic ring, which had been given to him long ago on his birthday.\n",
      "Bilbo guessed that this was the very ring that he had found, and as\n",
      "he had won the game, it was already his by right. But being in a tight\n",
      "place, he said nothing about it, and made Gollum show him the way\n",
      "out, as a reward instead of a present. This account Bilbo set down\n",
      "in his memoirs, and he seems never to have altered it himself, not\n",
      "even after the Council of Elrond. Evidently it still appeared in the\n",
      "original Red Book, as it did in several of the copies and abstracts.\n",
      "But many copies contain the true account (as an alternative), derived\n",
      "no doubt from notes by Frodo or Samwise, both of whom learned\n",
      "the truth, though they seem to have been unwilling to delete anything\n",
      "actually written by the old hobbit himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo’s first story, as soon as he\n",
      "heard it, and he continued to be very curious about the ring. Eventually he got the true tale out of Bilbo after much questioning, which\n",
      "for a while strained their friendship; but the wizard seemed to think\n",
      "the truth important. Though he did not say so to Bilbo, he also\n",
      "thought it important, and disturbing, to find that the good hobbit\n",
      "had not told the truth from the first: quite contrary to his habit. The\n",
      "idea of a ‘present’ was not mere hobbitlike invention, all the same.\n",
      "It was suggested to Bilbo, as he confessed, by Gollum’s talk that he\n",
      "overheard; for Gollum did, in fact, call the ring his ‘birthday-present’,\n",
      "many times. That also Gandalf thought strange and suspicious; but\n",

      "will be seen in this book.\n",

      "Of Bilbo’s later adventures little more need be said here. With the\n",

      "chiefly for the help of his friends; but he kept it secret from them as\n",
